## Test assignment

### Technical Exercise

Dear Software Engineer,
I have written an innovative new application! (initial code is located in the task.js file) This uses Cat as a Service (https://cataas.com)
and does the following:

1. Fetches an image of a cat with some custom text
2. Fetches an image of another cat with some more custom text
3. Binds these images together into one image
4. Saves the resulting image as a file
   But I need your help with a few things…

The Task
My coding skills are a bit rusty. Refactor my application to improve, harden and modernize
the code. Be prepared to verbally rationalize the changes you make.
Tips
Aim for
• Simplicity (less is more!)
• Maintainability
• Performance

This is a short exercise. Aim to spend approximately 1 hour
Zip your code up and share it with us or, alternatively, put it in a public Git repo.
Yours faithfully,
Phil Mander
VP Technology, Harver
